## Getting Started

In this interface created with tkinter, users' personal information is taken and saved in the table on the left. With Save User, the user is registered. With New user, the entries for the new user are reset and Disabled users can be hidden and marked as visible again.
In the content of the code, plenty of explanation lines and the websites necessary for you to get information have been added.

### Prerequisites
```
Python 3.x.x
Tkinter

### Installing
The only library required comes pre-installed with github. All we need is Python.

### Notes:
If tkinter is not installed and if you are getting error, just type: ` pip install tkinter` in cmd
